# Pomodoro Clock

Link: https://pparmin.github.io/Pomodoro/

### Description
This tiny application allows you to work with the Pomodoro technique on a very rudimental level. Just choose your preferred balance
between work and break time and hit play! 

### Future Updates
Basic keyboard support and an audio signal that you ran out of time. 

### Learning Outcome
The Pomodoro Clock is the third big JS/CSS/HTML project and has further cemented my knowledge about how to set-up simple web-applications
with vanilla JS/CSS.
